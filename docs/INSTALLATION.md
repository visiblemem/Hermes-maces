# Installation and Operations

## Preconditions

Record the Hermes version and MACES commit, back up the profile `config.yaml`, verify Hindsight health, and record hashes for the Obsidian vault, session SQLite, and profile memory. Install only one profile at a time.

## Install without enabling

```bash
hermes profile use default
hermes plugins install visiblemem/Hermes-maces --no-enable
```

Add the `plugins.entries.hermes-maces` section from `config.example.yaml` to the active profile's Hermes configuration. Do not use a `config.yaml` inside the repository as user configuration.

Populate a small allowlist for two or three known successful retrieval tools before beginning the shadow period; an empty allowlist plus no manual feedback produces no meaningful signals.

## Enable in shadow mode

```bash
hermes plugins enable hermes-maces
hermes gateway restart
```

Keep `shadow_mode: true`. Verify that the only new database is:

```text
<profile-HERMES_HOME>/data/maces/subconscious.db
```

Run shadow for at least seven days. Acceptance is based on privacy, concept quality, negation behavior, latency, profile placement, and host stability—not on learning volume.

## Enable influence

After human review, set `shadow_mode: false` for this profile and restart its gateway. Advisory output remains bounded to the configured limits and explicitly unverified.

## Observe

Use `/maces-status` for aggregate profile, shadow, table, database, decay, error, scrub, and latest influence metrics. Use `/maces-top [1-20]` for validated high-weight labels only.

## Roll back

```bash
hermes plugins disable hermes-maces
hermes gateway restart
```

Verify Hermes conversation, Hindsight recall, Obsidian, session SQLite, and profile memory. Keep MACES SQLite for inspection. Remove the plugin only after ordinary behavior is confirmed.

To wipe only MACES state, stop Hermes and delete `<profile-HERMES_HOME>/data/maces/`.
